How to find kth smallest element in unsorted array? (solution)
You are given an unsorted array of numbers and k, you need to find the kth smallest number in the array. For example if given array is {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} and k=2 then you need to find the 2nd smallest number in the array, which is 2. One way to solve this problem is to sort the array in ascending order then pick the k-1th element, that would be your kth smallest number in array because array index starts at zero, but can you do better? Once you are able to solve this array coding question, you can solve many similar questions easily e.g. our next question.
